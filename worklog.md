Work Log:
- Audited existing project structure (20 game files in public/game/)

- Rewrote OszLoader.js — multi-difficulty support, osu!→mania conversion, IndexedDB storage (BeatmapStore), DifficultyAnalyzer integration
- Rewrote NoteRenderer.js — Project Sekai perspective tilt (lanes converge to vanishing point at 40% width at top), trapezoid lanes, perspective-scaled notes, safeArea support

- Rewrote JudgementDisplay.js — positioned on RIGHT side of playfield, combo break display repositioned
- Rewrote SongSelect.js — osu!lazer-style (blurred background, song cards with thumbnails, difficulty tabs, empty state prompt, IndexedDB persistence, no demo songs, multi-.osz import)
- Rewrote ThreeScene.js — TV monitor repositioned to bottom-left corner (as if sitting in front of it), angled at 0.35rad yaw, -0.1rad pitch
- Rewrote Settings.js — added aspect ratio selector (16:9, 16:10, 4:3, 21:9, Fill), resolution scale slider (50-150%)

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix three user-reported issues: 1) OSZ preview images not persisting, 2) 3D TV not visible, 3) SongSelect layout redesign

Work Log:
- Fixed OszLoader.js: Added backgroundData/backgroundMime fields to store raw image bytes alongside Object URLs. Changed BeatmapStore.save() from JSON serialization to structured clone (Object.assign + explicit AudioBuffer/difficulties handling) so Uint8Array survives IndexedDB. BeatmapStore.loadAll() now recreates Object URLs from stored image data. DB_VERSION bumped to 2. Added backward compatibility for old JSON-serialized Uint8Array format.
- Fixed ThreeScene.js: Increased camera FOV from 60→75 so more of the scene is visible. Repositioned TV from (-4.5, -2.5, 1) to (-3.8, -2.0, 1.0). Enlarged TV geometry (3.0x2.2x0.3 vs 2.0x1.5x0.25). Added bezel, stand, and neck for better CRT aesthetic. Added brighter glow light on texture change.
- Redesigned SongSelect.js: Removed song-info-panel left sidebar. Added top-left song info overlay (title, artist, difficulty/BPM/length). Added difficulty dropdown that expands from song cards (osu!lazer style) when clicking diff count badge. Moved back button + search to centered top bar. Moved import button to top-right. Made background gradient transparent in bottom-left so 3D TV shows through.
- Updated page.tsx: Removed background from #screen div so each screen manages its own background transparency.
- Updated MainMenu.js, Settings.js, ResultScreen.js: Added explicit background:rgba(17,17,17,0.85) to each screen's root div.
- Updated ZZZTheme.js: Replaced diff-tabs CSS with .song-card-wrapper and .diff-dropdown CSS. Updated CRT click delegation to include .diff-dropdown-item. Made .song-card-diff-count look clickable with hover effects.

Stage Summary:
- OSZ preview images now persist across page reloads (backgroundData stored in IndexedDB)
- 3D TV is visible in bottom-left corner of SongSelect (FOV 75, proper positioning)
- SongSelect redesigned: no left panel, top-left info, difficulty dropdown from song cards
- All screens have self-managed backgrounds, #screen is now transparent
- Lint passes clean
